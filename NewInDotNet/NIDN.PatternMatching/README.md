# Description

There have been many improvements to pattern matching in C#, with recent versions introducing relational patterns (using relationships to constants with < <= > >=), extended property patterns, and adding `and`, `or`, and `not` to pattern matching.

Head over to [Program.cs](Program.cs) look at how some of these patterns can be used with the related `Gadget` and `BatteryPoweredGadget` types.
